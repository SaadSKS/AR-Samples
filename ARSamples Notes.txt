That would be the child, yes. Although, rather than making a child of the ImageTarget, which would still move with jitter, I'd make it an independent GameObject which follows that ImageTarget with interpolation.

The interpolation would be something like:

myPosition = Mathf.SmoothStep(myPosition, imageTargetPosition, strength);

Which IIRC would have to be done for each component of the position's Vector3. Strength would be a float, could be Time.deltaTime * some float to modulate the intensity.

Depending on the strength of the interpolation you would trade off between exact position and smoothness.
